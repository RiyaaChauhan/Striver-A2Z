#  Doubly Linked List (DLL)

##  Overview

In the realm of data structures, understanding **Doubly Linked Lists (DLL)** is essential. These structures are a powerful extension of linked lists, enabling efficient navigation in **both forward and backward directions**.

Before diving into DLLs, let’s quickly recap the fundamentals of a basic linked list.

##  Recap: Singly Linked List (SLL)

A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure composed of nodes. Each node contains:
- `data`: The value stored
- `next`: A pointer to the **next node** in the list

Traversal in a singly linked list is **unidirectional**—from head to tail only.

###  Python Code – Singly Linked List Node

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data        # Stores the data
        self.next = next        # Pointer to the next node
```

- The `Node` class has two attributes:
  - `data`: Holds the value (e.g., integer)
  - `next`: Points to the next node in the list
- The constructor initializes both values. If `next` is not provided, it's set to `None` (end of list)

##  Enter: Doubly Linked List (DLL)

**Doubly Linked Lists** enhance the structure of singly linked lists by adding a third attribute: a pointer to the **previous** node.

This enables **bidirectional traversal**, which is particularly useful in scenarios like:
- Navigating a browser’s back/forward history
- Implementing complex data structures like **deques** or **LRU caches**

###  Python Code – Doubly Linked List Node

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None, back=None):
        self.data = data        # Stores the data
        self.next = next        # Pointer to the next node
        self.back = back        # Pointer to the previous node
```

- `data`: Stores the value
- `next`: Points to the next node (same as in SLL)
- `back`: New addition – points to the previous node

###  Constructors Explained
- Full constructor: Accepts `data`, `next`, and `back`, allowing full control over connections
- Default constructor: Sets both `next` and `back` to `None`, useful when the node is created standalone

##  Differences Between SLL and DLL

| Feature                  | Singly Linked List          | Doubly Linked List             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Traversal Direction      | Forward only                | Forward & Backward            |
| Extra Pointer            | No                          | Yes – `back` pointer          |
| Memory Usage             | Less                        | More (extra pointer)          |
| Reverse Navigation       | Not possible                | Possible                      |
| Deletion Efficiency      | Needs access to previous node | Easier, no need to track previous |

##  When to Use DLL?
Use **Doubly Linked Lists** when:
- You need **fast insertion/deletion** from both ends
- You want to **traverse** in both directions
- You're implementing **LRU Cache**, **Text Editor Undo/Redo**, or **Deque**
