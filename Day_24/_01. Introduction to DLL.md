##  Doubly Linked List (DLL) Notes

###  What is a Doubly Linked List?

A **Doubly Linked List** is a type of linked list where each node contains:
- A `data` field
- A pointer/reference to the **next** node
- A pointer/reference to the **previous** node

```plaintext
NULL <- [prev | data | next] <-> [prev | data | next] <-> ... -> NULL
```

---

###  Structure of a Node (Python Example):

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```

---

###  Key Operations

#### 1. **Insertion**
- At the **beginning**
- At the **end**
- At a **given position**

#### 2. **Deletion**
- From the **beginning**
- From the **end**
- Of a **specific node**

#### 3. **Traversal**
- **Forward**: from head to tail
- **Backward**: from tail to head

---

###  Advantages of DLL over Singly Linked List
- Can be **traversed in both directions**
- **Easier deletion** of a given node without needing the previous node
- **More flexible** in operations like insertion before/after a node

---

###  Disadvantages
- **More memory usage** due to extra `prev` pointer
- Slightly **more complex** to implement
- **Slower operations** in some cases due to pointer management

---

###  Basic Python Implementation Example:

```python
class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        temp = self.head
        while temp.next:
            temp = temp.next
        temp.next = new_node
        new_node.prev = temp

    def display_forward(self):
        temp = self.head
        while temp:
            print(temp.data, end=' <-> ')
            temp = temp.next
        print("NULL")
```

- Reverse a DLL
- Detect loops (although rare in DLLs)
- Insert/Delete at position
- Convert DLL to binary tree or vice versa
