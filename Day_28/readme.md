###  Problem Summary:
You're given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. Each node contains a single digit, and digits are stored in **reverse order**. You need to add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list.

###  Code:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list node
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        # Dummy node to simplify edge cases
        dummy = ListNode()
        current = dummy
        carry = 0

        # Traverse both lists until all digits and carry are processed
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            # Extract current values from each list or 0 if None
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # Calculate total sum and carry
            total = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = total // 10
            digit = total % 10

            # Create a new node with the digit and attach to the result list
            current.next = ListNode(digit)

            # Move current pointer and input list pointers forward
            current = current.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        # Return the next of dummy since dummy is a placeholder
        return dummy.next
```

---

###  Explanation (Line-by-Line Notes):

- `dummy = ListNode()`:  
  Acts as a placeholder to start the result linked list. Helps avoid special cases when adding the first node.

- `current = dummy`:  
  This pointer will be used to build the result list by appending new nodes.

- `carry = 0`:  
  Keeps track of the carry from the sum of two digits (just like addition on paper).

- `while l1 or l2 or carry`:  
  Continue the loop if any list still has nodes or if there's a remaining carry to add.

- `v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0`:  
  Get the value from `l1` if it exists; otherwise, treat it as 0.

- `v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0`:  
  Same as above for `l2`.

- `total = v1 + v2 + carry`:  
  Add values and any carry from the previous step.

- `carry = total // 10`:  
  If the result is â‰¥ 10, set carry for the next iteration.

- `digit = total % 10`:  
  Keep only the unit digit to store in the current node.

- `current.next = ListNode(digit)`:  
  Create a new node with the digit and attach it to the result list.

- `current = current.next`:  
  Move forward to build the next node.

- `l1 = l1.next if l1 else None`, `l2 = l2.next if l2 else None`:  
  Move the input list pointers forward.

- `return dummy.next`:  
  The final result starts after the dummy node.

###  Example:

**Input:**
- l1 = [2, 4, 3] (represents 342)
- l2 = [5, 6, 4] (represents 465)

**Process:**
```
2 + 5 = 7 -> [7]
4 + 6 = 10 -> [0], carry = 1
3 + 4 + 1 = 8 -> [8]
```

**Output:**
- [7, 0, 8] (represents 807)

### ðŸ’¡ Tips for Interviews:

- Always ask if the digits are stored in **reverse** or **forward** order.
- Handle **carry** carefully.
- Use a **dummy node** to simplify edge cases.
- Test with **unequal length lists** and carry-over at the end (e.g., [9,9] + [1] = [0,0,1]).
