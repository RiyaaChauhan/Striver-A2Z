This folder contains problems that are **not part of the standard Striver Sheet** but are carefully selected to **deepen conceptual clarity**, **reinforce core logic**, and **simulate real-world interview challenges**.

---

#### 📌 Why This Folder Exists:
- To **build strong intuition** beyond brute force  
- To **expand problem coverage** for edge cases and interview scenarios  
- To **practice pattern extensions** — where known concepts are tested with new twists  
- To **avoid overfitting** to popular sheets and explore DSA holistically
