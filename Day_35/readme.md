# 1.Middle of a LinkedList [Tortoise-Hare Method]
- When we want to **delete a middle node** from a Linked List,  
  we use **two pointers**:  
  - `slow` â†’ moves **one step** at a time  
  - `fast` â†’ moves **two steps** at a time  

- `fast` reaching the end means `slow` is at the middle.  
- To **delete** the middle node, we need to maintain another pointer `prev`,  
  which always **lags one step behind slow**.  
- After finding the middle:  
  - we simply do `prev.next = slow.next` to **remove slow** from the list. âœ…

**Key Learning:**  
ðŸ‘‰ prev saves the position just before slow moves.
ðŸ‘‰ Thus, it always "tracks" one node behind slow.

Shortcut to remember ðŸ§ :
prev = slow â†’ before slow moves.
