## Problem: Single Number

You are given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, where every element appears exactly **twice**, except for **one element** that appears only once.  
Return the element that appears only once.

You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and **constant extra space**.

### Example

```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Brute Force Approach

### Intuition:
Use a hash map or dictionary to count the frequency of each number. Return the number whose count is 1.

### Code:
```python
def singleNumber_brute(nums):
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    for num in freq:
        if freq[num] == 1:
            return num
```

### Time Complexity: `O(n)`  
### Space Complexity: `O(n)`

### Why this is not optimal:
- It uses extra space (a hash map), which violates the **constant space** constraint.

## âš¡ Optimal Approach (Using XOR)

### Intuition:
- XOR of two same numbers is 0: `a ^ a = 0`
- XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself: `a ^ 0 = a`
- So if we XOR all numbers, duplicates will cancel each other and only the unique number will remain.

### Code:
```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
```

### Time Complexity: `O(n)`  
### Space Complexity: `O(1)`

### Why this works:
- Uses bitwise XOR properties to cancel out duplicate numbers efficiently with no extra memory.
