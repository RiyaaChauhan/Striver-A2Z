# Hashing 

## What is Hashing?

**Hashing** is a technique used to **map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size**, typically to enable **fast access** or **look-up**.

A **hash function** is used to compute an **index (or hash code)** into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

> Think of it like a library: the book title is the key, and the book's location is determined by the hash function.

---

## Why Hashing?

- **Fast Search**: Ideal for scenarios where you need **quick lookups**, like checking whether an item exists in a collection.
- **Efficient Insertion & Deletion**
- **Handles large data** efficiently

---

## Real-world Applications

- Implementing **hash tables**
- **Caching** (e.g., LRU cache)
- **Databases indexing**
- **Data de-duplication**
- **Password storage** (cryptographic hashing)
- **Checksums** for data validation

---

## Basic Terminologies

| Term              | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Key**           | The input to the hash function |
| **Hash Function** | Function that maps a key to an index |
| **Hash Table**    | The data structure that stores data using hashing |
| **Hash Value**    | Result of the hash function |
| **Bucket**        | A storage location in the hash table |
| **Collision**     | When two keys map to the same index |

---

## Hash Function

A **good hash function**:
- Should distribute keys uniformly across the table
- Should be fast to compute
- Should minimize collisions

### Example:
```python
hash_index = key % table_size
```

---

## Collision Handling Techniques

Collisions are **unavoidable**, so we need strategies to handle them:

### 1. **Chaining (Separate Chaining)**

- Each bucket is a **linked list** of entries that hash to the same index.

Pros:
- Easy to implement
- Can grow dynamically

Cons:
- Extra memory for pointers

### 2. **Open Addressing**

- When a collision occurs, **probe** for the next available slot.

#### Types of Open Addressing:

| Type                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Linear Probing**   | Check next slot `(index + 1) % size` |
| **Quadratic Probing**| Use quadratic jumps to find next slot |
| **Double Hashing**   | Use second hash function to determine jump size |

---

## Time Complexity (Hash Table Operations)

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Insert    | O(1)         | O(n) (with bad hash function) |
| Search    | O(1)         | O(n) |
| Delete    | O(1)         | O(n) |

In practice, with a **good hash function** and **load factor**, these are **almost always O(1)**.

---

## Load Factor

> Load Factor = (Number of elements in table) / (Size of table)

- **High load factor** = more collisions
- When it exceeds a threshold (usually 0.7), **rehashing** is triggered (resizing the table and re-inserting elements)

---

## Hash Table Implementations in Languages

| Language | Hashing Data Structure |
|----------|------------------------|
| Python   | `dict`, `set`          |
| Java     | `HashMap`, `HashSet`   |
| C++      | `unordered_map`, `unordered_set` |
| JavaScript | `Object`, `Map`, `Set` |

---

## Example in Python

```python
# Using dictionary (hash map)
hash_map = {}
hash_map['apple'] = 1
hash_map['banana'] = 2

print(hash_map['apple'])  # Output: 1
```

## Hashing-Based Problems in DSA

- Two Sum
- Subarray Sum Equals K
- Longest Consecutive Sequence
- Group Anagrams
- Top K Frequent Elements
- Isomorphic Strings

---

## Cryptographic Hashing (Extra Info)

Used for security-related applications (e.g., password storage, digital signatures)

Popular hash algorithms:
- MD5
- SHA-1, SHA-256

> These are **one-way** functions (you cannot reverse them), unlike regular hash functions.

##  Problem Recap (Using Number Hashing)

**Given:**

```python
arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]
queries = [1, 3, 4, 2, 10]
```

**Task:** For each query, return how many times it appears in `arr`.

---

##  Brute Force Approach (Python)

```python
def count_frequency_brute(arr, query):
    return arr.count(query)

for q in queries:
    print(f"{q} -> {count_frequency_brute(arr, q)}")
```

 **Time Complexity**: O(Q × N), where `Q = len(queries)` and `N = len(arr)`  
 **Slow for large inputs**

---

##  Optimized Approach using Hashing

### Step 1: Pre-storing Frequencies in a Hash Table (Python Dictionary)

```python
# Step 1: Build frequency map
frequency = {}
for num in arr:
    frequency[num] = frequency.get(num, 0) + 1
```

###  Step 2: Fetching Answer for Each Query

```python
# Step 2: Query the map
for q in queries:
    print(f"{q} -> {frequency.get(q, 0)}")
```

###  Visual Diagram

```
arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]

Step 1: frequency = {}

Loop:
1 -> frequency = {1: 1}
2 -> frequency = {1: 1, 2: 1}
1 -> frequency = {1: 2, 2: 1}
3 -> frequency = {1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}
2 -> frequency = {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1}

Queries:
1 -> 2
3 -> 1
4 -> 0 (not found)
2 -> 2
10 -> 0 (not found)
```

 **Time Complexity**:
- Preprocessing: O(N)
- Queries: O(1) each → O(Q) total  
 **Overall: O(N + Q)** — much faster!

## Character Hashing in Python

**String Example:**

```python
s = "abcdabefc"
queries = ['a', 'c', 'z']
```

### Frequency Map (Lowercase only)

```python
char_freq = [0] * 26  # for a-z

for ch in s:
    char_freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

for q in queries:
    print(f"{q} -> {char_freq[ord(q) - ord('a')]}")
```

### Visual Diagram

```
s = "abcdabefc"
Indexing:
a -> 0, b -> 1, c -> 2, ..., z -> 25

char_freq = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]

Queries:
a -> char_freq[0] = 2
c -> char_freq[2] = 2
z -> char_freq[25] = 0
```

---

## Character Hashing for All ASCII Characters (256)

```python
char_freq = [0] * 256

for ch in s:
    char_freq[ord(ch)] += 1

for q in queries:
    print(f"{q} -> {char_freq[ord(q)]}")
```

---

##  Hashing Large Numbers (like 10⁹)

You **cannot** use a list of size 10⁹ (memory limit). Use Python's dictionary (like C++ `unordered_map`):

```python
arr = [1000000000, 2, 1000000000, 3, 2]
frequency = {}

for num in arr:
    frequency[num] = frequency.get(num, 0) + 1

queries = [1000000000, 3, 4, 2, 10]
for q in queries:
    print(f"{q} -> {frequency.get(q, 0)}")
```

**Dictionaries in Python**:
- Are implemented using **hash tables**
- Have average **O(1)** time for insert and lookup
